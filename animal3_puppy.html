    <h1> Puppies: </h1>
    <h3> Puppies (juvenile dogs) can weigh 1-1.5 kgs (1-3 lb)  </h3>
    <h3> while larger ones can weight about 7-11 kgs (15-23 lb)</h3>
    <h3> When they are born, puppies spend most of their time </h3> 
    <h3> sleeping, and the rest of their time feeding. </h3>
    <h3> If a litter (group of puppies) exceeds six puppies,   </h3>
    <h3> particular if 1 or more are 'runts', human intervention </h3>
    <h3> in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is needed such that </h3>
    <h3> the runts get proper nourishment & attention from the mom </h3>
    <h3> A Fun Fact: The best (and easiest time) to domesticate a </h3>
    <h3> dog is when they are a young puppy. </h3>
