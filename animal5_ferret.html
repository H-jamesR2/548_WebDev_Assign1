    <h1> Ferrets: </h1>
	<h3> Ferrets are a domestic species of small mustelid and</h3>
	<h3> though to be a descendant of the European polecat which</h3>
    <h3> belongs to the same genus as the weasel, Mustela. </h3> 
    <h3> Ferrets were first introduced into the New World in the </h3>
    <h3> 17th century, and were used extensively from 1860 until the </h3>
    <h3> start of WW2 to protect American West granaries from rodents.</h3>
    <h3> Fun Fact: The name 'ferret' derives from the Latin word </h3>
    <h3> <i>furittus</i> meaning "little thief", likely referencing </h3> 
    <h3> to ferret's common behavior of secreting away miniature objects.</h3>
